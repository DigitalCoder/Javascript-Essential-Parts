<h2>Interesting HTML and HTML5 Q&A <h2>
<h3> What is the significance of `<!doctype html>`?</h3>
<p>DOCTYPE Declaration is the abbreviation for Document Type Declaration (DTD).
DOCTYPEs are required for legacy reasons. When omitted, browsers tend to use a different rendering mode that is incompatible with some specifications. Including the DOCTYPE in a document ensures that the browser makes a best-effort attempt at following the relevant specifications.
There are two modes. Quirk Mode and Standard Mode. If you avoid doctype it is rendered in quirk mode. QUIRK MODE was introduced to support the website built for legacy browsers. Also HTML validator doesn't work for quirk mode.
