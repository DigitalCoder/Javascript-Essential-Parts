What is a closure, and how/why would you use one?

A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.
The word "lexical" refers to the fact that lexical scoping uses the location where a variable is declared within the source code to determine where that variable is available.
Closures are functions that have access to the outer (enclosing) function's variablesâ€”scope chain even after the outer function has returned.

Why would you use one?

->Data privacy / emulating private methods with closures. Commonly used in the module pattern.
->Partial applications or currying.

Remember it this way. Closure is nothing but a function with preserved data.

Lets get into the details

closures are nothing but functions with PRESERVED data.

var Employee = function (name, company, salary) {
   var name = name ;       //Public attribute default value is null
    var company = company ; //Public attribute default value is null
    var salary =salary ; //Public attribute default value is null

    // Private method
    var increaseSalary = function (salary) {
        salary=  salary + 1000;
    };

    // Public method
    var dispalyIncreasedSalary = function() {
       
        console.log(salary);
    };
    return {increaseSalary:increaseSalary,dispalyIncreasedSalary:dispalyIncreasedSalary};
};

var e=new Employee("san","cdi",5000);
e.increaseSalary(1000);
e.dispalyIncreasedSalary();


To understand it you need to understsand lexical scoping

Anytime you try to access anything from outside the scope it becomes a closure.

The word "lexical" refers to the fact that lexical 
scoping uses the location where a variable is declared within the source code to determine where that variable is available.

What are practical examples of Closures?? Where would one use closure?
When you know data at a later time;

//closure 

GLobal scope is visible to all other scopes.In client-side JavaScript, 
the global scope is generally the web page inside which all the code is being executed.
A global object is defined in global scope.Window or global in case of node
